				<h1>Combat Climate Change</h1>
				<p>
					The rapid rise in industrialism has led to a massive increase in human emissions of carbon dioxide
					and other greenhouse gases -- the primary drivers of climate change. <br><br>
					Automation and digital intelligence can plant billions of trees to help combat climate change and lower global temperatures. <br><br>
					ReGrowth Drones can promote our restoration efforts, to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, by planting about tens of thousands of trees everyday.
				</p>

				<h1>End Deforestation and Restore Degraded Forests</h1>
				<p>
					Join the initiative in protecting, restoring, and promoting the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage local forests, and reverse land degradation and loss of biodiversity.  <br><br>

					ReGrowth Drones can expidite the process in which our forests heal and ensuring the conservation of our
					<a href="#sustainable_crops">native trees.</a>
				</p>

				<h1>Protect Biodiversity and Natural Habitats</h1>
				<p>
					Take immediate and significant action to reduce the degradation of our natural habitats, inhibit the loss of biodiversity and prevent the extinction of our threatened species.  <br><br>

					ReGrowth Drones reverse the effects of deforestation, allowing natural habitats to return and our biodiversity to flourish.

			<h3>Growing Automation</h3>
			<p>
				Farmers and growers can select from an extensive range of
				winter and summer seeds for sustainable crop production. Made to order
				seedpods include your choice of germinated seeds and nutrient rich
				hydrogel. Seed options include vegetables, grains, herbs and legumes.
			</p>

			<h2>Cost Efficient Native Planting</h2>
			<h3>Automated Reforestation </h3>
			<p>
				A variety of native plant seedlings can be
				<a href="#automated_farming">chosen to restore native forest</a> Nurseries provide native seedlings
				grown in mineral dense soil. Seeds are uniquely selected for each site.
				Seedlings include kanuka, manuka, harakeke and koromiko.

			<h3>Automated Farming and Forest Restoration</h3>
			<p>
				As our goal is to minimise long term cost, time, and labour, our drones are able to analyse the size, environment, and soil type of the area through their highly intelligent software as they are pre-programmed or fully autonomous to enable safe/accurate flight patterns deemed necessary for the process<br><br>
				<h3> Digital Reporting </h3>
				From this a detailed report is then created with the results and predations are calculated which allows the client/farmers/people to customise and select the <a href="#sustainable_crops">seeds</a> for planting as needed.<br><br>
				<h3> Dispersal within 24 Hours of Site Visit </h3>
				Our drone the next day will disperse the seed pods consistently across the project site as imputed by the client.
